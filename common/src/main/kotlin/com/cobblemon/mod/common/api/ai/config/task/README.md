# Task Configuration

A task configuration is responsible for producing one or multiple tasks as part of a
[BrainConfiguration](../README.md). Tasks are the smallest unit of behaviour in a brain and are executed
as part of an activity.

A task configuration can be a simple string that represents the type of task to create, or a JSON object
which a `type` property that describes what type of task is being created and other properties that configure it.

### one_of
The 'one_of' type creates a task that randomly selects one of the tasks in the list to execute each tick.
- `condition`: A MoLang expression (with `q.entity` as the entity) that determines if this entire task should exist on the entity or not. This runs at the time of entity creation, not on tick.
- `options`: A list of objects representing the different tasks that could run for a tick. Each object must have a `task`
    which is a task configuration. Optionally, you can also specify a `weight` which is a number that determines the 
    probability of the task being selected. If no weight is specified, the task will have a weight of 1.

### all_of
The 'all_of' type creates a task that executes all of the tasks in the list each tick.
- `condition`: A MoLang expression (with `q.entity` as the entity) that determines if this entire task should exist on the entity or not. This runs at the time of entity creation, not on tick.
- `tasks`: A list of task configurations to execute each tick.

### do_nothing
The 'do_nothing' type creates a task that does nothing for some period of time.
- `condition`: A MoLang expression (with `q.entity` as the entity) that determines if this entire task should exist on the entity or not. This runs at the time of entity creation, not on tick.
- `minDurationTicks`: A MoLang expression that determines the minimum number of ticks to do nothing. Defaults to 40. Has `q.entity` as the entity.
- `maxDurationTicks`: A MoLang expression that determines the maximum number of ticks to do nothing. Defaults to 80. Has `q.entity` as the entity.

### random
The 'random' type creates a task that chooses one of the contained tasks when the entity is spawned. Note that this does not save forever,
so if the entity is reloaded, it will choose a new task. To make persisting randomization you have to use MoLang conditions on other task
configurations that use `q.entity.id_modulo(some_number)` to apply randomization based on the entity UUID.
For example, `q.entity.id_modulo(2)` will return 0 or 1 for an entity but will always be the same for the same entity,
so using `q.entity.id_modulo(2) == 0` as a task condition will make it occur for 50% of entities and remain after reloads.
`q.entity.id_modulo(3)` will return 0 or 1 or 2, and so on.

### follow_walk_target
The 'follow_walk_target' type creates a task that makes the entity follow a walk target. This does not choose the walk target,
it is only responsible for ensuring the entity will follow a path to whatever the current walk target is. Note that the target
does not necessarily need to be a land target.
- `condition`: A MoLang expression (with `q.entity` as the entity) that determines if this entire task should exist on the entity or not. This runs at the time of entity creation, not on tick.
- `minRunTicks`: A MoLang expression that determines the minimum number of ticks to run to the target before stopping. Defaults to 150.
- `maxRunTicks`: A MoLang expression that determines the maximum number of ticks to run to the target before giving up. Defaults to 250.

### look_at_target
The 'look_at_target' type creates a task that makes the entity look at a target. This does not choose the target, it is only
responsible for ensuring the entity will look at the target position.
- `condition`: A MoLang expression (with `q.entity` as the entity) that determines if this entire task should exist on the entity or not. This runs at the time of entity creation, not on tick.
- `minDurationTicks`: A MoLang expression that determines the minimum number of ticks that the entity will look at the target. Defaults to 40.
- `maxDurationTicks`: A MoLang expression that determines the maximum number of ticks that the entity will look at the target. Defaults to 80.

### stay_afloat
The 'stay_afloat' type creates a task that makes the entity stay afloat in water instead of quietly sinking and drowning.
- `condition`: A MoLang expression (with `q.entity` as the entity) that determines if this entire task should exist on the entity or not. This runs at the time of entity creation, not on tick.
- `chance`: A MoLang expression that determines the chance of the entity trying to stay afloat. The higher it is, the more desperately it stays above the water. Defaults to 0.01. You don't need to change this, honestly.

### wander
The 'wander' type creates a task that makes the entity wander around randomly.
- `condition`: A MoLang expression (with `q.entity` as the entity) that determines if this entire task should exist on the entity or not. This runs at the time of entity creation, not on tick.
- `shouldWander`: A MoLang expression that determines if the entity should wander. Defaults to `math.random(0, 20*8) <= 1`, which makes it wander approximately once every 8 seconds.
- `horizontalRange`: A MoLang expression that determines the maximum distance the entity will wander in a single path. Defaults to 10.
- `verticalRange`: A MoLang expression that determines the maximum vertical distance the entity will wander from its starting position. Defaults to 5.
- `speedMultiplier`: A MoLang expression that determines the speed multiplier for wandering. Defaults to 0.35 which is a standard walk speed.
- `completionRange`: A MoLang expression that determines the distance from the target location that the entity needs to be for the path to be considered complete. Defaults to 1.
- `lookTargetYOffset`: A MoLang expression that determines the vertical offset of the look target from the target walk position. Defaults to 1.5. You probably don't need to change this.

### look_at_entities
The 'look_at_entities' type creates a task that will randomly set the entity's look target to a nearby entity.

### switch_to_panic_when_hostiles_nearby
The 'switch_to_panic_when_hostiles_nearby' type creates a task that will switch the entity to the panic activity when hostiles are nearby. The definition of nearby depends
on the entity type and this piggy-backs off the Minecraft list of aggressive mobs and the right distances.
- `condition`: A MoLang expression (with `q.entity` as the entity) that determines if this entire task should exist on the entity or not. This runs at the time of entity creation, not on tick.

### run_script
The 'run_script' type creates a task that will run a MoLang script every tick on this entity. This has the risk of being very laggy
if the script is doing expensive things. Remember to use `q.entity.world.game_time` and `math.mod` to do intermittent actions inside
the script to avoid lagging the game.
- `script`: A resource location identifying the script to run. This should be in the `molang` datapack folder.

### look_in_direction
The 'look_in_direction' type creates a task that will make the entity look in a specific direction at all times where they aren't being told to look elsewhere.
